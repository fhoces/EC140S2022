# What Defines a Data Set?

.font90[
- Data Set is the collection of any type information (of multiple *Datum*)

- In quantitative analysis we focus on *structured* data sets (unlike, for example, unstructured field notes).

- In econometrics the most commnon way to structure data is in tabular, or rectangular, form. 

- A tabular data set is a collection of variables that with information for one or more entities. 

- Entities can represent multiple individuals, one individual over time, firms, countries, etc. 

- Variables are represented in columns, and observations are represented by rows. (for more on variables [The Effect, Ch3](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DescribingVariables.html#descriptions-of-variables))

# Mean

-  The mean is defined by the sum of a set of values divided by the number of values. 

Let’s look at the mean from the "hang out with a friend" exercise. 

- Total over N




$$
`\begin{equation}
Average(X) = \frac{ 1 \times 10 + 
                    2 \times 9 + 
                    3 \times 11 }{30} =
                    \color{#9370DB}{2.03}
\end{equation}`
$$



- One number, **highly informative** for a variable of interest.
- Always important to keep an eye on the units and magnitude (relevant for PS1).

---
# Mean of a Binary Variable

- The interpretation for the mean of a binary variable is different from the case when there are more than two values. 

- Above, the interpretation of `\(Average(X) = 2.03\)` can be read as "close to having an OK time with a friend". 

- But when variables only take two values, and we assing those values to be 0 and 1, the interpretation of the mean is "the proportion of all the cases where the variable takes the value of one". 

- Think of the the variable `hispanic` for students in this classroom (1 if identifies as hispanic, 0 otherwise).

# Expected Value

- Let’s look at the histogram for the exercise above (drawn in the board) and pretend it is not a sample but the entire population. How can we move from frequencies into probabilities?

- Replace frequencies by probabilities

- The population version of the sample mean is the **expected value**. 

---
# Expected Value: Definition (Discrete)

The expected value of a discrete random variable `\(X\)` is the weighted average of its `\(k\)` values `\(\{x_1, \dots, x_k\}\)` and their associated probabilities:

# Expected Value: Definition (Discrete)

The expected value of a discrete random variable `\(X\)` is the weighted average of its `\(k\)` values `\(\{x_1, \dots, x_k\}\)` and their associated probabilities:

$$
`\begin{aligned}
\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X) &amp;= x_1 \mathop{\mathbb{P}}(X = x_1) + x_2 \mathop{\mathbb{P}}(X = x_2) + \dots +x_k \mathop{\mathbb{P}}(X = x_k) \\
&amp;= \sum_{x} \color{#FD5F00}{x} \color{#007935}{\mathop{\mathbb{P}}(X = x)} = \sum_{x} \color{#FD5F00}{x} \color{#007935}{f(x)}
\end{aligned}`
$$




- Also known as the .hi[population mean]. Compare it to the sample mean: 

$$
`\begin{equation}
\overline{X}_{n} = \sum_{x}  \color{#FD5F00}{x} \times \color{#007935}{prop_{n}(x_{1})}\\ 
\end{equation}`
$$

# Expected Value

## Example

Rolling a six-sided die once can take values `\(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)`, each with equal probability. .hi-purple[What is the expected value of a roll?]

--

`\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(\text{Roll}) = 1 \times \frac{1}{6} + 2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 3 \times \frac{1}{6} + 4 \times \frac{1}{6} + 5 \times \frac{1}{6} + 6 \times \frac{1}{6} = \color{#9370DB}{3.5}\)`.

- __Note:__ The expected value can be a number that isn't a possible outcome of `\(X\)`.

---
# Expected Value. Definition (Continuous)

.pull-left[

If `\(X\)` is a continuous random variable and `\(f(x)\)` is its probability density function, then the expected value of `\(X\)` is

$$
\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) dx.
$$

- __Note:__ `\(x\)` represents the particular values of `\(X\)`.

- Same idea as the discrete definition: describes the .hi[population mean].

# Expected Value. Definition. One Last Thing 1/2

Let's go back to the mean of our exercise:

$$
`\begin{equation}
\overline{X}_{n} = \color{#FD5F00}{1} \times \color{#007935}{\frac{10}{30}} + 
         \color{#FD5F00}{2} \times \color{#007935}{\frac{9}{30}} + 
         \color{#FD5F00}{3} \times \color{#007935}{\frac{11}{30} }  =
                    \color{#9370DB}{2.03}\\
\end{equation}`
$$

But now let's switch the values of the random variables to: 10, 20, 30. How should we compute the mean?



--
$$
`\begin{equation}
\overline{g(X)}_{n} = \color{#FD5F00}{10} \times \color{#007935}{\frac{10}{30}} + 
         \color{#FD5F00}{20} \times \color{#007935}{\frac{9}{30}} + 
         \color{#FD5F00}{30} \times \color{#007935}{\frac{11}{30} }  =
                    \color{#9370DB}{20.33}\\
\end{equation}`
$$

---
# Expected Value. Definition. One Last Thing 2/2

Hence, we can conclude, that for a random variable `\(X\)`, any transformation `\(g(X)\)` has a sample aveage:

$$
`\begin{equation}
\overline{X}_{n} = \sum_{x}  \color{#FD5F00}{g(x)} \times \color{#007935}{prop_{n}(x_{1})}\\ 
\end{equation}`
$$


And an expectation: 


$$
\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(g(X)) = \color{#9370DB}{\sum_{x}} \color{#FD5F00}{g(x)} \color{#007935}{f(x)}
$$

The same idea applies in the case of a continues random variable

# Expected Value: Rules (or Properties)

## Rule 1 

For any constant `\(c\)`, `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(c) = c\)`.

--

## Not-so-exciting examples 

`\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(5) = 5\)`.

`\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(1) = 1\)`.

`\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(4700) = 4700\)`.

---
# Expected Value

## Rule 2

For any constants `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`, `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(aX + b) = a\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X) + b\)`.

--

## Example 

Suppose `\(X\)` is the high temperature in degrees Celsius in Eugene during August. The long-run average is `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X) = 28\)`. If `\(Y\)` is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, then `\(Y = 32 + \frac{9}{5} X\)`. .hi-purple[What is] `\(\color{#9370DB}{\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(Y)}\)`.hi-purple[?]

--

- `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(Y) = 32 + \frac{9}{5} \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X) = 32 + \frac{9}{5} \times 28 = \color{#9370DB}{82.4}\)`.

---
# Expected Value

## Rule 3: Linearity

If `\(\{a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n\}\)` are constants and `\(\{X_1, X_2, \dots , X_n\}\)` are random variables, then

$$
\color{#FD5F00}{\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(a_1 X_1 + a_2 X_2 + \dots + a_n X_n)} = \color{#007935}{a_1 \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_1) + a_2 \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_2) + \dots + a_n \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_n)}.
$$

In English, .hi-orange[the expected value of the sum] .mono[=] .hi-green[the sum of expected values].

---
# Expected Value

## Rule 3

.hi-orange[The expected value of the sum] .mono[=] .hi-green[the sum of expected values].

## Example 

Suppose that a coffee shop sells `\(X_1\)` small, `\(X_2\)` medium, and `\(X_3\)` large caffeinated beverages in a day. The quantities sold are random with expected values `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_1) = 43\)`, `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_2) = 56\)`, and `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_3) = 21\)`. The prices of small, medium, and large beverages are `\(1.75\)`, `\(2.50\)`, and `\(3.25\)` dollars. .hi-purple[What is expected revenue?]

--

$$
`\begin{aligned}
\color{#FD5F00}{\mathop{\mathbb{E}}(1.75 X_1 + 2.50 X_2 + 3.35 X_n)} &amp;= \color{#007935}{1.75 \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_1) + 2.50 \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_2) + 3.25 \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X_3)} \\
&amp;= \color{#9370DB}{1.75(43) + 2.50(56) + 3.25(21)} \\
&amp;= \color{#9370DB}{283.5}
\end{aligned}`
$$

# Expected Value

## __Caution__

Previously, we found that the expected value of rolling a six-sided die is `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}} \left(\text{Roll} \right) = 3.5\)`.

- If we square this number, we get `\(\left[\mathop{\mathbb{E}} ( \text{Roll} ) \right]^2 = 12.25\)`.

__Is__ `\(\left[\mathop{\mathbb{E}} \left( \text{Roll} \right) \right]^2\)` __the same as__ `\(\mathop{\mathbb{E}} \left(\text{Roll}^2 \right)\)`__?__

--

__No!__

$$
`\begin{aligned}
\mathop{\mathbb{E}} \left( \text{Roll}^2 \right) &amp;= 1^2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 2^2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 3^2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 4^2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 5^2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 6^2 \times \frac{1}{6} \\ &amp;\approx 15.167 \\ &amp;\neq 12.25.
\end{aligned}`
$$

---
# Expected Value

## __Caution__

Except in special cases, .hi-purple[the transformation of an expected value] __is not__ .hi-green[the expected value of a transformed random variable].

For some function `\(g(\cdot)\)`, it is typically the case that

`$$\color{#9370DB}{g \left( \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(X) \right)} \neq \color{#007935}{\mathop{\mathbb{E}} \left( g(X) \right)}.$$`

# Activity 1
 - Let's watch [another Stat 110's video](https://youtu.be/sheoa3TrcCI). Then get together in groups of 3 and discuss:
    - Don't worry about the law of large numbers yet
    - How does the random variables becomes continuous?
    - How does linearity help with computations?
