# DD and Regression 2/2  
  
- Regression equation (show how $+\delta_{DD}$ is the DD):

$$
\begin{equation}
Y_{dt} = \alpha + \beta TREAT_d + \gamma POST_t +\delta_{DD} (TREAT_d \times POST_t) + e_{dt}
\end{equation}
$$
--

- Regression estimates: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{dt} = 167 - &29 TREAT_d - 49 POST_t +20.5 (TREAT_d \times POST_t) + e_{dt}\\
  &(8.8) \quad\quad \quad\quad(7.6) \quad \quad\quad(10.7)
\end{aligned}
$$
- Standard errors of a OLS regression will be to small (overestimate precision) as they assume independent observations. 

- Within a unit (district) observations will not be independent, making it less information that with 12 fully independent observations.

# DD Estimates Using Real Outputs
.pull-left[
- Beyond number of banks what matters most is a measure of economic activity 
- Here there is more limited data (back to the world of 4 points) so we inspect the results without regression. 
- DD estimate on number of wholesale firms: 181
- DD estimate on net wholesale sales ($ millions): 81

# Back to Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA)

- Wide range of state rules regarding MLDA over time: 
  - 1933: After Prohibition Era ended, most states set MLDA at 21. 
      - Some exceptions: Kansas, New York, North Carolina.
  - 1971: most states lower MLDA to 18.
      - Some exceptions: Arkansas, California, Pennsylvania. 
  - 1984-88: All states transition back to 21. But at different times.  

- So much variation at the state level! (makes sense that the DD method was [formally developed in the US](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~card/papers/train-prog-estimates.pdf))


---
# Regression for MLDA using two states
- To illustrate: let's start with a setup equivalent to the Mississippi Study. 

- Two states:
  - Alabama (treatment): lower MLDA to 19 in 1975.
  - Arkansas (control): MLDA at 21 since 1933.
- Outcome $(Y_{st})$: death rates per state $(s)$ for 18-20-year-olds from 1970 to 1983 $(t)$. 

$$
\begin{equation}
Y_{st} = \alpha + \beta TREAT_s + \gamma POST_t +\delta_{DD} (TREAT_s \times POST_t) + e_{st}
\end{equation}
$$
--

- Where $TREAT_s$ is a binary variable that takes the value 1 for Alabana and 0 for Arkansas. And $POST_t$ is a binary variable that takes the value 1 from the year 1975 onwards and 0 otherwise. 



---
# Regression Using All States 1/3
 
- But why stop there? There are other "experiments" in other states (e.g. Tennessee's MLDA drop to 18 in 1971, then up to 19 in 1979) 

- Two state regression requires some changes: 
  - There are many post treatment periods, so instead of $POST_t$, we control for each year by including a binary per year $YEAR_{jt}$ (leaving out one year as the category of reference). 
      - E.g., $YEAR_{1972,t}$ is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 when the observation, indexed by $t$, is in the year 1972 and 0 otherwise. 
      - This variables that capture the effects that are fixed within a year, are called year fixed effects. 


---
# Regression Using All States 2/3
- More changes to the two state regression:  
  - Before the variable $TREAT_s$ effectively was controlling for the differences between the two states in the regression. 
  - Now there are many states, and each vary in treatment type, but we still want to control for the effect of each state.  What should we do?
--
  
  - Instead of $TREAT_s$ we control for each state by incluiding a binary per state $STATE_{ks}$ (leaving out one state as the category of reference). 
      - E.g., $STATE_{CA,s}$ is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 when the observation, indexed by $s$, is in the state of California and 0 otherwise.


---
# Regression Using All States 3/3
- More changes to the two state regression:      
  - Finally, there are two variations required regarding the measurement of treatment (captured before by the interaction $TREAT_s \times POST_t)$:
      - Time and location of treatment application cannot be pinned down with one single interaction
      - Treatment intensity varies across states and time: 
          - Some states went form 21 to 18 (similar to $TREAT_s \times POST_t = 1$ before) 
          - Other states went, for example, from 18 to 19. 
          - To capture this new treatment we defined $LEGAL_{st}$ as the fraction of the population with ages between 18 - 20 that were legaly allowed to drink   in state $s$ at time $t$.

# Regression Equation

- Given the definitions for $LEGAL_{st}, STATE_{ks}, YEAR_{j,t}$ , and of an outcome $Y_{st}$ that measures the death rates for 18 - 20 years-olds in state $s$ at time $t$ our regression equations for the period 1970 to 1983 is:

Y_{st}  = \alpha  + \delta_{DD} LEGAL_{st} +...

# Two-Way Fixed Effect = Generalized DD

$$
\begin{equation}
Y_{st}  = \alpha  + \delta_{DD} LEGAL_{st} + \sum_{k = Alaska}^{Wyoming} \beta_k STATE_{ks} + \sum_{j = 1971}^{1983} \gamma_{j} YEAR_{jt} + e_{st}
\end{equation}
$$

- The variables $STATE_{ks}, YEAR_{j,t}$ are known as state and year fixed effects. Combined in one regression equation are sometimes called two-way fixed effect model.  
--

- This data structure where there are observations across an entity dimension (state) and another dimension (typically time), is called a **panel data**. 
--

- We have just seen how panel data estimation with fixed effects for its two dimensions, is a generalized version of the DD estimation method!
- The books makes this connection but it does not emphasize it enough (given the widespread use of "FE" terminology in economics these days).

# Results

.pull-left[
- Focus on column 1 for now. 
- Qualitatively similar effect to the RDD study (7.7-9.6) for all deaths. 
- Slightly larger effects on MVA deaths than RDD study (4.5 - 5.9)
- Smaller effects on suicide deaths
- Similar effects on internal deaths (non alcohol related)

---
# Relaxing the parallel trends assumption
- Whenever there is more data on previous trends (before the treatment), the parallel trends assumption can be relaxed by controlling for a different slope for each state over time. 

- When relaxing this assumption DD will only be able to identify large and sharp effects. If the effects are small and/or appear in the outcomes slowly over time, this modification will not find it. 



$$
\begin{equation}
Y_{st}  = \alpha  + \delta_{DD} LEGAL_{st} + \sum_{k = Alaska}^{Wyoming} \beta_k STATE_{ks} + \sum_{j = 1971}^{1983} \gamma_{j} YEAR_{jt} + \\
\sum_{k = Alaska}^{Wyoming} \theta_k (STATE_{ks} \times t)  + e_{st}
\end{equation}

# .font80[Final Condideration of DD: The Key Requirement Variation Over Time] 
- Remember the short description of MM about DD: “The DD tool amounts to a comparison of trends over time” 

- Implicit in this statement is that DD depends on variation in the changes of a variable over time (in addition to betwen treatment and control). 

- This approach has the big benefit of removing any OVB that is constant over time. But it comes at the costs of loosing all the variation within a specific time period. 

- Less variation in the data will imply larger SEs, hence it will be harder to detect significance (or easier to not reject the null).
