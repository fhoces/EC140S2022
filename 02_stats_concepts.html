# Random Variables 1/4

Imagine you are meeting with a friend later today and let’s assume of the three following situations can happen: 
- You have the most wonderful time that you could have had today with your friend.
- It was ok, but you were kind of expecting to have a better time today. 
- You had a really bad time, your friend did not stop talking about herself and never checked on you.

--

Roll one Die: 

- If you get a 1 or a 2, the first situation happen
- If you get a 3 or a 4, the second situation took place
- 5 or 6 corresponds to the last situation



---
# Random Variables 2/4
.pull-left[
Each of these situations is what is called an **event** in statistics. Two key characteristics of events are
  - They must be mutually elusive
  - The collection of all events (called the event space) must contain all the posible outcomes. 

This events look a bit hard to keep track of...

.pull-right[

Let's assign a number to each event: 

<div id="htmlwidget-5d84222661a8e8dcf75e" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-5d84222661a8e8dcf75e">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"caption":"<caption>Numbering Events<\/caption>","data":[["You have the most wonderful...","It was ok, but...","You had a really bad time, ..."],[1,2,3]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\\(Event\\)<\/th>\n      <th>\\(X\\)<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"dom":"t","ordering":false,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-center","targets":"_all"}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
]

---
# Random Variables 3/4

.pull-left[

- This assignment from event to numerical values is what a **random variable** does. 

- For this case, where there is a discrete number events, we called this a  **discrete random variable**

- You might be used to thinking about variables as collections of numbers in a line (or multiple lines). 


]


.pull-right[

<div id="htmlwidget-54e0c40667909d34950a" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-54e0c40667909d34950a">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"caption":"<caption>Numbering Events<\/caption>","data":[["You have the most wonderful...","It was ok, but...","You had a really bad time, ..."],[1,2,3]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\\(Event\\)<\/th>\n      <th>\\(X\\)<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"dom":"t","ordering":false,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-center","targets":"_all"}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

- A random variable is similar in the sense that it is a collection of numbers, but it is different in the sense that each number represents an event. 

]


---
# Random Variables 4/4


- Another potential source of confusion is that the idea of connecting something with other numbers is similar of the role of a function, not variables. We need random variables first to move from events into numbers.

--

- Random variables can also be continued, but for this we cannot talk of an Event-value mapping, instead we combine the event and value in the same object (the number of the random var.). 
    - Example: income. In the continuous case, the idea of an event is not so meaningful (what is the likelihood of an income of 33,593.4355?) 
    - Hence, when working with continuous random variables we will refer to ranges. 

---

# Seeing Theory

  - Let's go to [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html#section1) and play a bit with a discrete random variable
      - For example: think of that event space as a field where you are throwing a ball
--

Now we have all we need to define a random variable. 

- **Random Variable** is a numerical summary of a random outcome. 

--

- We now know what a random variable is. Notice that we have almost not talk about how likely or unlikely each of these values are, we have not talked about its *proportions in the long run*. 


---
# Probability Distribution Functions  1/4

- "Proportions in the long run", is a bit of a mouthful. Let’s put a name to it, let’s call it **probabilities**. 

- Now we need a mapping from an event (“Most wonderful time that you could have had today with your friend”, or 1) into a probability. 

---
# Probability Distribution Functions  2/4


- This mapping will be described by a function `\(P(X=x)\)` that represents the probability that a random variable `\(X\)`, takes the specific value of `\(x\)` (e.g., 1, or "Most wonderful ...").

<div id="htmlwidget-951fb7dbedcabc933c6c" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-951fb7dbedcabc933c6c">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"caption":"<caption>Events, Random Variables, and Probabilities<\/caption>","data":[["You have the most wonderful...","It was ok, but...","You had a really bad time, ..."],[1,2,3],["1/3","1/3","1/3"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\\(Event\\)<\/th>\n      <th>\\(X\\)<\/th>\n      <th>\\(P(X = x)\\)<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"dom":"t","ordering":false,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-center","targets":"_all"}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

# Probability Distribution Functions  3/4

 - The **probability distribution function** of a discrete random variable is the list of all possible values of a variable and the probability that each value will occur. 
 
 - Notation. Sometimes you will see it express as `\(P(X=x)\)` or as `\(f(x)\)`. The former applies only to discrete PDFs, the latter can be used for both continous or discrete random variables. 
 
 - A closely related concept describes the acumulated probability of a collection of events. How would you write the probability that people in this room had "At least an ok time with their friend"
 
 
---
# Probability Distribution Functions  4/4

- This Cumulative Distribution Function describes the probability that a random variables is less or equal than a particular value. `\(P(X\leq x)\)`

- Lets go to [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html#section1) again and explore some PDFs and CDFs of discrete random variables. 
    - Bernoulli: success and failure, 0 and 1. Show how p characterizes the entire distributions. Review ranges and values of PDF and CDF. 
    - Binomial as example of combining RVs.




---
# Activity 1 


 - The mythical [Stat 110 team](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) shows us how the concepts of Discrete Random Variables and Probability Distributions can be used in practice. 
 - Let's watch [this video](https://youtu.be/ZoIPuTIPviY). Then get together in groups of 3 and discuss:
    - What is the event space?
    - What is the random variable?
    - What is the probability distribution that one person is cured?
    - How does the Binomial(10, 0.6) relates to that previous distribution?



---
# Probability Density Functions 1/2

- For the case of continuous random variables, lets think of what is the probability of a specific event (e.g., income 34,680.0003). 

--

- For continued random variables we cannot talk about a (specific) probability distribution, we use instead the concepts of density (as in how much is there in any given range). 

- The probability that a continues random variable lies between any given range (of two points) is defined as the area under the **probability density function**  of a continuous random variable. [This is a very abstract concept] 

- The density function is typically denoted by `\(f(x)\)`. 


---
# Probability Density Functions 2/2


- Note that any specific value of `\(f(x)\)` should not be interpreted as a probability. 

- The area under the the probability density function, or density, is the cumulative distribution function between two points: 

$$ 
`\begin{equation}
P(x_{1} \leq X \leq x_{2}) = \text{area betwen } f(x_{1}) \text{ and } f(x_{2})\\
\end{equation}`
$$

# Seeing Theory 2

- Lets go to [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html#section1) again and explore some PDFs and CDFs of continous random variables. 
    - Uniform: great to represent ignorance.
    - Normal to show how just two parameters can characterize and entire prob distribution. 
    - Exponential to show that weird shapes can happen. [Check this video](https://youtu.be/XXjlR2OK1kM) for a great demonstration of how this type of distributions appear in real life.
    - Beta to show that one distribution can describe many phenomena. Talks about range.

---

# Activity 2
 - Let's watch [another Stat 110's video](https://youtu.be/UVQs9zikfe0). Then get together in groups of 3 and discuss:
    - What is the type of random variables are represented by Norma and Randy?
    - What is Norma's take on how to address the paradox describe by ancient philosophers?
    - The concept of error tolerance presented in the video correspnds to which concept discuss in previous slides?
    - The last 2 mins on prediction are outside the scope of our course.

## Uniform Distribution

The probability density function of a variable uniformly distributed between 0 and 2 is

$$
f(x) =
`\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{2} &amp; \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 2 \\
  0 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0 \text{ or } x&gt;2
\end{cases}`
$$

## Uniform Distribution

By definition, the area under `\(f(x)\)` is equal to 1.

The .hi[shaded area] illustrates the probability of the event `\(1 \leq X \leq 1.5\)`.

- `\(\mathop{\mathbb{P}}(1 \leq X \leq 1.5) = (1.5-1) \times0.5 = 0.25\)`.

.hi-purple[The "bell curve."]

- Symmetric: mean and median occur at the same point (_i.e._, no skew).

- Low-probability events in tails; high-probability events near center.

# Continuous Random Variables

## Normal Distribution

The .hi[shaded area] illustrates the probability of the event `\(-2 \leq X \leq 2\)`.

- "Find area under curve" .mono[=] use integral calculus (or, in practice, .mono[R]).

- `\(\mathop{\mathbb{P}}(-2 \leq X \leq 2) \approx 0.95\)`.
